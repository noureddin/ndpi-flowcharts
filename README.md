# nDPI Flowcharts (Unofficial)

These are (unofficial) flowcharts for [nDPI](https://github.com/ntop/nDPI) library.

They are made to be a slide-show, so most functions are split into several diagrams, each is a screen-full or less.

View them at: [noureddin.github.io/ndpi-flowcharts](https://noureddin.github.io/ndpi-flowcharts/index.html) (For the best experience, use the fullscreen mode.)

Made using [Dia](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia).
